Running Environment
===================
This code is supposed to be run on UNIX machines. The following
commands are required:

- g++
- make
- split

All methods require MPI libraries. Available implementations include

- OpenMPI
You can find the information about OpenMPI at

http://www.open-mpi.org/

- MPICH
You can find the information about MPICH at

http://www.mpich.org/


Usage
=====
To compile the code, type

	> make

To train a model distributedly, we provide a script "split.py" to split data into segments.
This scripts requires a file of the node list, and assume one I/O thread per node is used.
That is, we do not allow duplicated machines in the list file.
We provide an example of the node list in the file "machinelist"
Assume the original training file name is train_file.
If you are using an NFS system, then the segmented filenames will be train_file.00,
train_file.01,...
The enumeration starts from 0, and all files are of the same number of digits for enumeration.
If you are not using an NFS system, then specify this by the option -f 1.
To see the full usage of this script, type

	> python split.py

The segmented files will then be copied to the machines and all will have the same filename train_file.sub.

To run the package, type

	> mpirun -hostfile machinelist ./train

and see the usage.
